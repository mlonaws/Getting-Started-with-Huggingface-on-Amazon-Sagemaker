## Workshop: **Getting Started with HuggingFace on Amazon SageMaker**

Training your first NLP Transformer model with Hugging Face on Amazon Sagemaker and deploying for real time Inference either directly from trained model or previously trained model saved on S3.

You will learn how to use Amazon SageMaker to train a Hugging Face Transformer model and deploy it afterwards.

- Prepare and upload a test dataset to S3
- Prepare a fine-tuning script to be used with Amazon SageMaker Training jobs
- Launch a training job and store the trained model into S3
- Deploy the model after successful training
- Deploy the model previously saved to S3
